Idio conditions
---------------

:lname:`Idio` conditions are instances of a hierarchy of :ref:`struct
type` which are used to convey a message about the system state.

The obvious states are *errors* albeit that the vast majority are
really *exceptions* which can be handled and the only real errors are
static coding errors.
