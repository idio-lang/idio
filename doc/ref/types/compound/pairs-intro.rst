Pair Type
=========

Pairs are the primary compound type.  A pair is a value with
references to two other values called the *head* and *tail*.

If the tail references another pair then you can envisage a chain
forming, more commonly called a *list*.

The head can also reference another pair, or any other type, leading
to arbitrary complex structures.
