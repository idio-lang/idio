Unicode Type
============

The *unicode* type is a representation of Unicode_ (arguably
ISO10646_) code points.  In practice they are much like an integer
ranging from 0 to 0x10FFFF although they do not overlap or have any
direct interaction with integers, they are a separate type.


Reader Forms
------------

The canonical reader form is :samp:`#U+HHHH` where the number of hex
digits, :samp:`{H}`, is "enough."  Leading zeroes are not required,
``#U+127`` is the same as ``#U+0127``.

An alternate reader form is :samp:`#\\x` where :samp:`{x}` is the
UTF-8 representation of the code point -- for example, ``#\Ä§`` would
be read as U+0127 (LATIN SMALL LETTER H WITH STROKE).

A final reader form is for a limited number of named characters, say,
``#\{newline}``, with the name in braces.

We could, but we don't, use the Unicode Character Database names, say,
``#\{LATIN SMALL LETTER H WITH STROKE}``.

Instead the set of names is limited to:
