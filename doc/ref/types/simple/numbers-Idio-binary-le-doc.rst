apply the less-than-or-equal comparator to numbers

:param n1: number
:type n1: number
:param n2: number
:type n2: number
:return: the result of comparing the arguments
:rtype: boolean

If any arguments are bignums then every argument is converted to a
bignum before calculating the result.

The use of the function ``binary-le`` is normally the result of the
``le`` infix operator.
