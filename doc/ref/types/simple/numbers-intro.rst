Number Types
============

Numbers in :lname:`Idio` are either "small" integer :ref:`fixnums
<fixnum type>` or "arbitrary" precision :ref:`bignums <bignum type>`
which can be integers, floating point numbers and support a notion of
exactness.

You can also use the :lname:`C` base types, ``C/char``, ``C/int``,
etc. and supported ``typedef``\ s thereof, although they are usually
used within :ref:`libc <libc module>`.
