Multiple Values
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Everything returns a value and that value could be a compound type
like a list.

In many circumstances, the implicit assignment of multiple values to
multiple variables (either named variables or function parameters) is
a desirable effect.  This is a common trope in many programming
languages.

:lname:`Idio` does not specifically handle the return or receipt of
multiple values but there are a number of helper functions.
