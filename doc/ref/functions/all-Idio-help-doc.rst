provide some helpful documentation for `sym`

:param sym: name to describe
:type sym: symbol
:return: ``#<unspec>``

Some provenance is given for functions; field and ancestry details for
structs; imports and exports for modules.

.. note::

   ``help`` is a template so you do not need to quote `sym`.

   The documentation is currently the raw reStructuredText.  Some
   re-imagining is required.
