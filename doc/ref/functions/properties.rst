Value Properties
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We can associate properties with *values*.  Normally these are the
signature and document strings for functions and a name for closures.

The properties of a value are a :ref:`keyword table <keyword table
type>`.  You can then reference or set a property within that table.

.. note::

   Property tables are not automatically created for values.
