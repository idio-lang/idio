C Functions
-----------

.. attention::

   All of the :lname:`C` functions will only operate on arguments of
   the same :ref:`C base types <c module types>` (or typedefs
   thereof).

The :lname:`C`-variant primitives for ``+``, ``-``, ``*`` and ``/``
are called from the arithmetic primitives :ref:`+ <+>`, :ref:`- <->`,
:ref:`* <*>` and :ref:`/ </>`.  They are not primitives exported from
the ``C`` module.
