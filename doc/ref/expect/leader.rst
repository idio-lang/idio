Expect_ is :ref-author:`Don Libes`' tool for managing interactive
applications.  It was written as an extension to :ref-author:`John
Ousterhout`'s Tcl_.  As a mark of its utility, `alternative ports
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expect#Alternatives>`_ have appeared in
many languages.  :lname:`Idio` is no exception.

The ``expect`` module handles simple :manpage:`expect(1)`-like
behaviour.
