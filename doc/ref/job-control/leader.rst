Job Control Module
==================

Job Control in :lname:`Idio` is very closely allied to the description
of `Job Control
<https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Job-Control.html#Job-Control>`_
in the GNU libc manual.

Almost all of :lname:`Idio`'s Job Control is written in :lname:`Idio`
meaning it is "easy" to augment.
