.. _`evaluator`:

Idio Evaluator
==============

The *evaluator*'s role is to consume the Abstract Syntax Tree, infer
some meaning from it and produce some intermediate code suitable for
the *code generator*.

The code generator will produce more specific byte code for the
*virtual machine* to interpret.

The code generator and virtual machine are beyond the scope of this
language reference.
