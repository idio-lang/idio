:default: " \\t\\n"

:var:`IFS` is the Input [#]_ Field Separator and is the default value
used when :ref:`fields <fields>` is used to split a string into
substrings.

.. [#] In :lname:`Bash` it is the *Internal* Field Separator and is
       used for both input and output field separation processing and
       unlike :program:`awk`'s :var:`RS` and :var:`ORS`, say.
