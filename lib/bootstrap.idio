#*

One problem with meta-programming functionality into a language is
that anything defined before such functionality is added doesn't get
to use it.  Duh!  That might be things like "module" or
even (infix) "+".

So we need to carefully stagger things into life noting that if you
author any bootstrap code you might need to go back to basics.
