    # WSL1 anomalous behaviour wants us to go a step further.
    #
    # Here, suppose a command running under a pty can have output
    # something and quit.  If everything is a bit slow then, assuming
    # we only now call poll(2) with both output and closed-output
    # pending, WSL1 only reports POLLHUP and does not report
    # POLLIN|POLLHUP.
    #
    # If you slow everything down some more (strace -f -e trace
    # write=all ...) then some gap appears where you'll get a POLLIN
    # and then a POLLHUP.
    #
    # It's somewhat annoying as, everywhere else, a POLLHUP on its own
    # means the other end of the pty has gone away.  If the other end
    # goes away with data pending you'll get POLLIN|POLLHUP for as
    # long as there is data pending and we (will have) handled the
    # POLLIN first.

    # We can't blindly ignore POLLHUP and rely on read(2) returning 0
    # because if nothing was output, perfectly valid for /bin/true,
    # and we have a POLLHUP then read(2) will return EIO.
    #
    # So we could look to capture EIO at every turn.  In the case of
    # the expect code in Idio-land by using trap -- hint: very
    # expensive.  Or we could have the read(2) wrapper code in
    # src/libc-api.c return some sentinel value for EIO which then
    # requires that every caller be aware that the sentinel value is
    # possible.  Or we could special-case WSL1 (and any others) at the
    # one-off cost of an extra clause in this script to identify the
    # issue.

    # Somewhat compounding the issue is that OpenBSD 6 and NetBSD 9
    # will both set IDIO_POLLHUP_OCCLUDES_POLLIN even though they pass
    # all the (problematic on WSL1) expect tests.

    # XXX We only want to say that IDIO_POLLHUP_OCCLUDES_POLLIN if it
    # really does occlude it in which case that's the only time that
    # we can exit (0).  Any other failure is, um, a success.
