We're looking to walk down a hierarchy of .idio files and compile
them.

*#

module compilation

import compile

lib-dir := #f

(regex-case IDIO_CMD_PATH
	    ("(.*)/bin/idio" {
	      lib-dir = append-string r.1 "/lib/idio/" IDIO_MM_VERSION
	    })
	    (else {
	      eprintf "%s: cannot determine library directory from %s\n" ARGV0 IDIO_CMD_PATH
	      exit 1
	    }))

printf "%s: working in %s\n" ARGV0 lib-dir

for fn in (glob (append-string lib-dir "/*.idio")) {
  printf "Compiling %s\n" fn
  (pattern-case fn
		;; bootstrap.idio includes everything else
		("*/bootstrap.idio" #f)

		;; job-control.idio gets messed up because | is already an operator
		("*/job-control.idio" #f)
		(else {
		  compile-file fn
		}))
	      
}
