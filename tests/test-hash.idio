;; Make sure it fails!  That is to say, check we are actually using

;; Here we want to provoke the ht-integer-hash into producing an
;; error, an ^rt-parameter-type-error in particular, because we're
;; trying to insert a character as a key when ht-integer-hash only
;; works with integers.

;; Note that this trap handler returns 0 (zero) to the {raise} in
;; {ht-integer-hash} which, in turn returns it to the internals of
;; {hash-set!}.  So even though {ht-integer-hash} only works with
;; integers and correctly raised an error we have told it to shut up
;; and use 0 regardless.

;; If you judiciously add debug statements to this you might realise
;; that more than one trap gets raised (probably).  This is because
;; when we calculate our index in the hash we potentially need to
;; follow a chain.  So we call the hashing function once to determine
;; which chain to follow.  Is it is a non-zero chain you *should* end
;; up with an out-of-hash-index.  That means that we have to call the
;; hashing function again in the parent (dumb, I know) to decide how
;; to insert this key within the chain.  We then call at least two
;; verify_chain functions, each of which calls the hashing function on
;; our key in the chain.
