;; We have a bunch of test cases which should provoke a ^read-error or
;; ^string-error of some kind.  So we can write a load function which
;; will wrapper the actual load with a trap for (^read-error
;; ^string-error) and compare the message strings (and line numbers
;; for ^read-errors).

;; So one or two tests per, uh, test.
