Issue #229: NULL vtable

The ordering of C types initialisation doesn't necessarily match the
order of type usage.  Strings are created before the string module is
initialised meaning

dump-vtable (handle-name (current-input-handle))


is nil.

*#

trap ^rt-vtable-method-unbound-error (function (c) {
  "^rt-vtable-method-unbound-error"
}) {
  test (display-string (handle-name (current-input-handle))) "*stdin*"
}
