Github Issue #2: adding two negative widely sized numbers fails

*#

module tests/issues/2

;; The clause in question asks that if the two numbers were more than
;; IDIO_BIGNUM_SIG_MAX_DIGITS * 2 decimal places apart then we can
;; shortcut the addition by just returning the larger.
;;
;; Except, when the numbers are negative we actually want to return
;; the smaller (as in more negative).

lp :=  1e40
ln := -1e40
sp :=  1e0
sn := -1e0

;; the actual issue
test (ln + sn) ln
test (sn + ln) ln

;; The clause affect positive numbers as well so let's apply due
;; diligence.
test (lp + sp) lp
test (sp + lp) lp
