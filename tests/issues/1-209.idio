Issue #209: On systems which have IDIO_BIGNUM_SIG_SEGMENTS > 1.  In
our case 32-bit systems.

This is not (cannot!) be observed on systems with
IDIO_BIGNUM_SIG_SEGMENTS = 1 (ie. 64-bit systems).

Idio> printf "%.18f\n" 0.12345678901234567890
0.123456789012345678000000000

The problem was in looping over the remaining segments we correctly
break when we've enough digits but didn't set the remaining precision
to 0.  A clause immediately afterwards added the remaining precision's
worth of 0s to the end.

test (format "%.18f" 0.12345678901234567890) "0.123456789012345678"
