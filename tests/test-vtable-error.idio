vtable-error0 := Tests

#*

We have a bunch of test cases which should provoke a
^rt-parameter-error.  So we can write a load function which will
wrapper the actual load with a trap for ^rt-parameter-error and
compare the message strings.

*#

vtable-error-load := {
  n := 0

  function/name vtable-error-load (filename msg) {
    if (not (string? filename)) (error/type ^rt-parameter-type-error 'load "string" filename)

    n = n + 1

    exp-tests := 1

    ;eprintf "loading #%s %s looking for %s\n" n filename msg
    trap (^rt-vtable-unbound-error
	  ^rt-vtable-method-unbound-error) (function (c) {
	    ;eprintf "vtable-error #%s: %s %s\n" n msg (idio-error-location c)
	    test (idio-error-message c) msg

	    if (not (string=? (idio-error-message c) msg)) {
	      condition-report (append-string "vtable-error-load: " filename) c (current-error-handle)
	    }

	    trap-return 'vtable-error
	  }) {
	    t0 := Tests
	    (symbol-value 'load 'Idio) filename
	    if (not (equal? Tests (t0 + exp-tests))) {
	      eprintf "vtable-error #%s: %s did not generate \"%s\"\n" n filename msg
	      Errors = Errors + 1
	      Tests = t0 + exp-tests
	    }
    }
  }
}

;; ^rt-vtable-unbound-error is tricky to reproduce as we've made a bit

Tests? (vtable-error0 + 1)
