#*

We have a bunch of test cases which should provoke a ^rt-glob-error
or ^rt-parameter-error.  So we can write a load function which
will wrapper the actual load with a trap for
(^rt-glob-error ^rt-parameter-error) and compare the message
strings.

*#

path-error-load := {
  n := 0

  function (filename msg) {
    if (not (string? filename)) (error 'load "not a string" filename)

    load-k := #n

    n = n + 1

    exp-tests := 1

    ;eprintf "loading #%s %s looking for %s\n" n filename msg
    trap (^rt-glob-error
	  ^rt-parameter-error) (function (c) {
				  ;eprintf "path-error #%s: %s %s\n" n msg c.location
				  test c.message msg

				  if (not (string=? c.message msg)) {
				    condition-report (append-string "path-error-load: " filename) c (current-error-handle)
				  }

				  load-k 'path-error
	  }) {
	    call/cc (function (k) {
		       load-k = k
		       t0 := Tests
		       (symbol-value 'load 'Idio) filename
		       if (not (equal? Tests (t0 + exp-tests))) {
			 eprintf "pair-error #%s: %s did not generate \"%s\"\n" n filename msg
			 Errors = Errors + 1
			 Tests = t0 + exp-tests
		       }
	    })
	  }
  }
}
