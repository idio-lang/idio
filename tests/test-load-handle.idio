XXX weird namespace feature

If we are not in the Idio module then any command in the following
cont-expr will be subject to each word being treated as a new symbol
-- and getting a warning about it.  See the code in
idio_vm_get_or_create_vvi().

It will, however, still get run -- as unknown symbols are thrown at
the execve() mechanisms.

So why is it OK (aka not warned about) in the Idio namespace?

*#
cont-expr := "(false)"

ish := open-input-string cont-expr

; running the command false will do two things: 1. generate a SIGCHLD
; 2. generate a ^rt-command-status-error (as "false" returned a
; non-zero exit status)
trap ^rt-signal-SIGCHLD (function (c) {
			   ;eprintf "test-load-handle trap: SIGCHLD\n"
			   test #t #t
			   raise c
}) {
  trap ^rt-command-status-error (function (c) {
				   ;eprintf "test load-handle trap: %s with %s\n" c.message c.status
				   test #t #t
  }) {
    ;printf "NOTICE: test-load-handle.idio: exec false; this will be picked up by test load-handle trap: pre\n"
    load-handle ish
    ;printf "NOTICE: test-load-handle.idio: exec false; this will be picked up by test load-handle trap: post\n"
  }
}

;; all done?
Tests? (load-handle0 + 4)
