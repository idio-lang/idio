#*

{format} and the underlying {%format} allow us to use printf(3)-ish
escape sequences for strings and numbers.

What is correct?  Modulo Unicode-strings (for which printf appears to
use UTF-8 bytes) we can compare the the output from Bash's printf
built-in.

There may be discrepancies with The Truth as Idio is not (currently?)
rounding.
