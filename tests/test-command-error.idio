#*

We have a bunch of test cases which should provoke a ^rt-command-error
or ^rt-parameter-type-error.  So we can write a load function which
will wrapper the actual load with a trap for (^rt-command-error
^rt-parameter-type-error) and compare the message strings.

There is a complication with commands, though, in that many of the
potential errors are going to fire in a child process, not in us. 

So, first up, we need to distinguish between conditions raised in the
parent process before we get going and then, secondly, conditions
raised in the child process which need (somehow) signalling back to
the parent.

Parent process errors should be much like other error handling code.
Child process errors need to be handled more carefully.  There's two
processes in play, for a start!

It so happens a default-child-handler trap should be arranged in the
child which will exit (1) on any ^idio-error (not just
^rt-command-error).

However, since we have forked, *this* ^rt-command-error is also in
force which, as it will successfully handle ^rt-command-error, will
return to the top level and...carry on doing whatever the toplevel was
doing.  That might well be to continue the REPL.  Which is confusing
as both parent and child are toggling reads from the controlling tty.

So, for child errors, we need to handle two cases:

In the child we can check the specific error and exit with some
specific N.  There's no point in using {test} as only the parent
process cares.

In the parent we can check that the "job failed" and that the exit
code was N (and that it was 'exit and not 'killed or 'unknown).  Three
tests per test.

It is possible that our choice of N is in conflict with something
else (in the codebase).  About all we can do is use something
not "normal" (1, 2, 3) but not > 127 when it will get confused with
signals.  So, 10, 11, 12, ...
