#*

We have a bunch of test cases which should provoke a ^rt-command-error
or ^rt-parameter-type-error.  So we can write a load function which
will wrapper the actual load with a trap for (^rt-command-error
^rt-parameter-type-error) and compare the message strings.

There is a complication with commands, though, in that many of the
potential errors are going to fire in a child process, not in us. 

So, first up, we need to distinguish between conditions raised in the
parent process before we get going and then, secondly, conditions
raised in the child process which need (somehow) signalling back to
the parent.

Parent process errors should be much like other error handling code.
Child process errors need to be handled more carefully.  There's two
processes in play, for a start!

It so happens a default-child-handler trap should be arranged in the
child which will exit (1) on any ^idio-error (not just
^rt-command-error).

However, since we have forked, *this* ^rt-command-error is also in
force which, as it will successfully handle ^rt-command-error, will
return to the top level and...carry on doing whatever the toplevel was
doing.  That might well be to continue the REPL.  Which is confusing
as both parent and child are toggling reads from the controlling tty.

So, for child errors, we need to handle two cases:

In the child we can check the specific error and exit with some
specific N.  There's no point in using {test} as only the parent
process cares.

In the parent we can check that the "job failed" and that the exit
code was N (and that it was 'exit and not 'killed or 'unknown).  Three
tests per test.

It is possible that our choice of N is in conflict with something
else (in the codebase).  About all we can do is use something
not "normal" (1, 2, 3) but not > 127 when it will get confused with
signals.  So, 10, 11, 12, ...

command-child-error-load is for, uh, children of us.  The problem lies
in that the (currently two) cases only occur once we have forked and
are constructing the environment before execing the command.

So the condition we are looking for occurs in the child Idio process.
In order that the parent Idio (us) gets to know if the child Idio saw
the condition is for the child Idio to exit with a specific error code
-- something not a usual exit code, 1, 2, ....  So we'll use an
EXIT-STATUS of 10, 11, ....  No-one uses those, right?

So, PARENT fork() -> CHILD -> contructs env for exec()

CHILD runs idio_command_get_envp() which raises our expected
condition.  As we'd only forked and not yet done anything useful the
following trap is still in force hence the second clause, where PID
!= (getpid), can test the condition message and if it matches then
call exit(EXIT-STATUS).

If the condition message doesn't match then exit with something
non-zero but not unusual, hence 1.

The PARENT hangs about waiting for the CHILD.  The PARENT gets an
^rt-command-status-error (because the CHILD exited non-zero) and can
assert that the reason the child died was because it called
exit(EXIT-STATUS) which it uses as a proxy for the CHILD having seen
the expected condition.

Of course, if the expected condition was not raised and therefore the
command actually ran and just happened to call exit(EXIT-STATUS) by
sheer coincidence then...well, we'll have to think  of something else.
