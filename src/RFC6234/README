 RFC 6234 - US Secure Hash Algorithms (SHA and SHA-based HMAC and HKDF)

This is the "demonstration implementation of these secure hash
functions in C" as extracted from Chapter 8 of the RFC.

The source code is verbatim which requires that modern, zealous C
compilers be restrained in their eagerness to find fault.  See
Makefile for details.
